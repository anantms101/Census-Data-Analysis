# Census Data Analysis of Ernakulam District, Kerala - 2011

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive statistical analysis of the 2011 Census data for Ernakulam District, Kerala, conducted as part of a dissertation for the Integrated M.Sc. Programme in Basic Sciences - Statistics at St. Albert's College (Autonomous), Ernakulam. The study explores demographic and socioeconomic indicators such as literacy rates, sex ratios, workforce participation, and rural-urban disparities to uncover trends and inform policy recommendations.

## Objectives
- Analyze key demographic indicators (e.g., literacy rate, sex ratio).
- Examine workforce participation across rural and urban areas.
- Investigate relationships between socioeconomic factors (e.g., literacy vs. workforce participation).
- Identify regional disparities and clusters using advanced statistical techniques.
- Provide policy recommendations for sustainable development.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: 2011 Census of India, covering 117 villages/towns and 94 variables.
- **Techniques**:
  - Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, correlation analysis, and regression.
  - Advanced methods like cluster sampling, cointegration, and Granger causality.
  - Visualizations including histograms, bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots, and pie charts.
  - Python-based analysis for data processing, modeling, and visualization.
- **Tools**: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, sklearn), Excel.

## Key Findings
- **High Literacy**: Ernakulam boasts a 94.83% literacy rate, exceeding Kerala's 94.00%, but with notable low-literacy outliers (minimum 30.54%).
- **Workforce Participation**: Higher in rural areas (40%) than urban (35%), with a significant gender gap (males: 72.98% of workers).
- **Sex Ratio Stability**: Uniform across administrative levels (mean: 1027 females per 1000 males).
- **Socioeconomic Disparities**: Scheduled Tribes (1.37%) show concentrated presence in rural areas; agriculture drives rural employment.
- **Long-Term Trends**: Strong cointegration between literacy and workforce participation; literacy predicts employment (Granger causality, p=0.0348).

## Policy Recommendations
- Enhance female workforce participation through training and childcare support.
- Target low-literacy clusters with educational interventions.
- Modernize agriculture to sustain rural employment.
- Address urban underemployment with skill development programs.

## Repository Contents
- **DRAFT.pdf**: Full dissertation document with detailed analysis, visualizations, and Python code in the appendix.
- **Code**: Python scripts for visualizations, regression, ARIMA forecasting, cointegration, and Granger causality (Appendix A-H).
- **Data**: References to the 2011 Census dataset (not included due to size; available from Census of India).

## Future Directions
- Explore migration and economic impacts on post-2011 trends.
- Investigate digital literacy's role in employment.
- Analyze longitudinal gender dynamics and ST/SC socioeconomic roles.
